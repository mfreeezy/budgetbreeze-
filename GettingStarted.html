        <p>Why should I budget? This page will discuss why people should budget and provide examples. Why should I budget? Budgeting helps you create a plan to show you how you can spend your money every month. Having a budget also helps you to not run out of money/overspend. Budgeting can also help you make goals with your savings and have an emergency plan. Budgeting can help you with things like overspending, learning your spending habits, preparing for retirement savings, and help you work toward long-term goals.</p>

    <h1>Next Steps</h1>
    <p>Now you are interested in budgeting but don’t know where to start. Great, this is where you pick a budgeting plan based on your needs/wants. Below are the different budget plans we will provide for you: Pay yourself first budget, envelop system budget, 50/30/20 budget, and the no budget. </p>
    </div>
    <div id="row3" class="row">
        <h1>Pay Yourself First Budget</h1>
        <p>The first simple budgeting method is the pay-yourself-first budget. This focuses on building your savings and paying bills and debt. When you get paid you set aside a specific amount for savings, bills, and debt. After that, you spend the rest as you please! This helps you prioritize saving and pay off debt. This budget is best for people who struggle to save every month and don’t want to specifically budget every expense.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="row4" class="row">
        <h1>Envelope System</h1>
        <p>The second budgeting method is the envelope system. In this system you plan out you’re spending with envelopes, each spending category will have its own envelope. Once you have your envelopes labeled, you withdraw all the cash you need and fill each envelope based on your budget. Every bill/expense will be paid with cash from the envelopes and when you run out that’s all you can spend for that month. If you do run out that month you can take cash from another envelope. Taking cash from other envelopes is not recommended though because it can become a habit and have an opposite effect.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="row5" class="row">
        <h1>50/30/20 Budget</h1>
        <p>The third budgeting method is the 50/30/20 budget. 50% of your income is spent on necessary expenses like rent etc. 30% of your income is spent on things like travel, entertainment, travel, etc. 20% of your income is spent on savings and debt payments. You don’t have to specifically stick to 50/30/20 you can customize it to your needs like increasing your savings portion. </p>
    </div>
    <div id="row6" class="row">
        <h1>The "No Budget".</h1>
        <p>The fourth budgeting method is the “no budget.” This focuses on helping you spend money that you don’t have and making better decisions. When doing This method, you should always keep track of your checking account to track expenses. Keep track of when your bills are due, you can use Excel for this to make it easier. Next, you should always have extra cash and savings when using this method. Also, for this method, it's better to have automatic payments. The rest you can spend as you please just don’t overdraw your account. This method is recommended for people who are strict with themselves and can say no to things. A method that goes along with this no-budgeting method is Minimalism. Minimalism is basically buying things that you only need. Not falling for the trends and new things that come out. Only buy things you need and that add value to your life and not giving in to your wants. </p>
