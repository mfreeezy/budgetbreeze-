            <p>Why should I budget? Budgeting helps you create a plan to show you how you can spend your money every month. Having a budget also helps you to not run out of money/overspend. Budgeting can also help you make goals with your savings and have an emergency plan. Budgeting can help you with things like overspending, learning your spending habits, preparing for retirement savings, and help you work toward long-term goals.
